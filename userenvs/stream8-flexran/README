Currently stream8-flexran userenv requires the user to finallize the 
values of 'image' and 'tag' keys. This is a temporary situation until 
we decide on what registry to use to meet Intel NDA requirement.  

In addition, bench-flexran mainly tests the image itself, and thus the
user likely wants to test a specfic image built for a specific FlexRAN 
release.
